Hey bro.

11/17/25: Learned how to embed p5 into HTML better.

Starting tomorrow, let's start to look at how I can pass state between different sketches better.
Let's build a window rendering system, so we can navigate and click on things,
and trigger certain events when we click on windows (such as sounds, animations, etc.).

Once we get the overhead in, we can be artsy with the particular animations and stuff.

JBPaint.js, look, it's cool, and it's a step in the right direction
but I was thinking very hard about each step, and how it fits into the website. 
The truth is, it doesn't yet. We need to be more intentional about how everything is placed
and how they all communicate their state.



11/18/25: bruh I like made a color manager and that's it.
I guess I made the template class as well. And window resizing and stuff. That was a lot to figure out...

Cool, passing p in is pass-by-reference (YES!)




Icon

import colorManager

p,
x, y, w, h 
name

constructor

isHovered()
isSelected()
print() (might add additional info based on name, etc)

(consider zoom?)




Palette
(a color manager)

(light mode and dark mode)
(merely changes 1 - color, i.e. invert)



siteNav (overhead for clicking on different sketches)




Would like to add the functionality to:
1. Read framerate, change render mode if necessary
2.
